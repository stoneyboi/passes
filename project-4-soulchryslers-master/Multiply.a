# This program does simple multiplication.
# It will (partially) test bne and j; 
# 	however, you will want verify that your branch and jump 
#	instructions work before running this test.
# 	(If they don't work, this script will probably enter 
#	an infinite loop.)

# BRANCH if the first multiplier is 0, then there is nothing to do

	beq  $s0, $zero, END	# if $s0 == 0, branch to 'END'

# ADD the second multipler ($s1) to the product ($s2),
# then decrement the first multiplier by 1, until it reaches 0.

# We're done.  The extra lines are just to make sure the final jump
